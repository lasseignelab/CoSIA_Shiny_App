# CoSIA_Shiny_App
A ShinyApp for CoSIA

https://lasseignelab.shinyapps.io/CoSIA/

CoSIA is a package that provides researchers with an alternative methodology for comparing across species 
and tissues using normal wild-type RNA-Seq Gene Expression data from Bgee. Using RNA-Seq Gene Expression data, 
CoSIA provides multiple visualization tools to explore the transcriptome diversity and variation across genes, 
tissues, and species. CoSIA uses Coefficient of Variation, Shannon Entropy, and Specificity to calculate transcriptome 
diversity and variation. CoSIA also provides additional conversion tools and utilities to provide a streamlined methodology 
for cross-species comparison across the tissues and genes of five commonly used biomedical research species (_Mus musculus_, 
_Rattus norvegicus_, _Danio rerio_, _Drosophila melanogaster_, and _Caenorhabditis elegans_) in addition to Homo sapiens.
